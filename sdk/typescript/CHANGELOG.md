# `@myndhyve/wop` Changelog

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-27

Aligned with WOP spec v1.0 final. Pinned to v1.0.0 alongside the spec corpus tag and the Python + Go reference SDKs.

### What's covered

- All 12 documented REST endpoints have a 1:1 SDK method (discovery, workflows, runs lifecycle, SSE + poll events, cancel, fork, interrupt resolve by run + by token).
- `Idempotency-Key` supported on every mutation method via the `idempotencyKey` option.
- Typed `RunConfigurable` surface with reserved keys (`recursionLimit`, `model`, `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `promptOverrides`) plus pass-through for impl extensions.
- SSE consumer accepts `streamMode` as a single value or an array (S4), accepts `bufferMs` query forwarding (S3), and transparently flattens `event: batch` arrays back into per-event yields so existing consumers don't change.
- Trace-ID surfacing — `WopError` captures W3C `traceparent` from response headers and exposes `error.traceId`; `error.toString()` auto-suffixes `(trace=<id>)` per `observability.md` §Trace context propagation.
- Zero runtime dependencies. Hand-authored to mirror the OpenAPI surface 1:1 (rationale in README §rationale).

### Deferred to v1.x

- Webhook subscription endpoints (spec still firming).
- Artifacts endpoints (signature unstable).
- Auto-retry with exponential backoff (needs cross-impl agreement on retry policy).
- Browser bundle (`@myndhyve/wop/browser`).
