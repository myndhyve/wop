# WOP Spec v1 — Capability Declaration (`/.well-known/wop`)

> **Status: FINAL v1.0 (2026-04-27).** Reconciled with PR 3b.1.1 + 3b.2 + CR #3 fixes, then formalized as `schemas/capabilities.schema.json` (per JS2). The in-package `Capabilities` shape is locked **(stable)** — see "In-package shape" below. The full network-handshake at `GET /.well-known/wop` is a superset that adds discovery/transport/observability fields tagged **(future)**. Conformance suite scenarios `discovery: /.well-known/wop` (3 scenarios) verify the stable surface end-to-end. Keywords MUST, SHOULD, MAY follow [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119). See `auth.md` for the status legend.

---

## Why this exists

External clients (CLIs, SDKs, agents from other ecosystems) need a deterministic way to discover what a WOP-compliant server can do *before* they issue requests. Specifically:

- Which protocol version they're talking to (and whether their client is too old)
- Which envelope types and node types are registered
- What hard limits apply (recursion, run duration, request body size)
- Which transports are exposed (REST, MCP, A2A, gRPC)
- Which OTel attribute taxonomy traces will use
- Which `configurable` keys are accepted on per-run overrides

This document specifies the public surface. The richer in-package `Capabilities` type used by the engine itself (defined by impl plan PR 3b.1 in `packages/workflow-engine/src/protocol/capabilities.ts`) is a superset of this network shape.

---

## Endpoint

A WOP-compliant server MUST expose:

| Method | Path | Auth | Cache |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/.well-known/wop` | None (public) | `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` recommended |

The path follows [RFC 8615](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615) `.well-known` URI conventions. The response MUST be JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`.

A server MAY expose this at additional paths for backward compatibility but MUST treat `/.well-known/wop` as canonical.

---

## Two surfaces

The reference implementation now has a real `Capabilities` type (PR 3b.1.1, file `packages/workflow-engine/src/protocol/Capabilities.ts:69`). Its scope is **narrower** than this network-handshake document covers:

- **In-package `Capabilities`** — what the engine tells the LLM in the system prompt. 5 fields. **(stable)** — see "In-package shape" below.
- **Network-handshake `Capabilities`** — what `GET /.well-known/wop` returns to external clients. Superset of the in-package shape plus discovery/transport/observability/configurable. **(future)** — see "Network-handshake superset" below.

The in-package shape is locked. The network-handshake superset is sketched here as the design target; fields beyond the in-package set are tagged **(future)** until a follow-up PR lands them.

---

## In-package shape (PR 3b.1.1, **(stable)**)

What the engine actually has today, used to format the system prompt:

```typescript
interface Capabilities {
  protocolVersion: string;                          // engine ↔ LLM contract version
  supportedEnvelopes: readonly string[];            // ['prd.create', 'theme.create', ...]
  schemaVersions: Readonly<Record<string, number>>; // { 'prd.create': 2, 'theme.create': 1 }
  limits: CapabilityLimits;                         // hard caps on LLM behavior
  extensions?: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>;   // per-canvas-type additions
}

interface CapabilityLimits {
  clarificationRounds: number;   // default 3
  schemaRounds: number;           // default 2
  envelopesPerTurn: number;       // default 5
}
```

**Default limits** (`DEFAULT_CAPABILITY_LIMITS` in `Capabilities.ts:118`):

```typescript
{ clarificationRounds: 3, schemaRounds: 2, envelopesPerTurn: 5 }
```

**Helper functions**:
- `buildCapabilities(opts)` — construct from envelope catalog + limits. Validates `schemaVersions` are non-negative integers (`Capabilities.ts:142`).
- `formatCapabilitiesForPrompt(caps)` — render as system-prompt text block. Sorts envelope types + extension keys deterministically for prompt-cache stability (`Capabilities.ts:186`).
- `mergeCapabilities(base, extension)` — per-canvas-type merge. Union of envelopes, extension wins on schema-version + limit conflicts (`Capabilities.ts:265`).

**Enforcement**: `CapabilityLimiter` (`packages/workflow-engine/src/protocol/CapabilityLimiter.ts`, PR 3b.2) tracks counters per (run, task, turn) and emits `CapabilityLimitExceededError` on breach.

| `aiProviders.byok` | `string[]` | **(future)** | G22 — subset of `aiProviders.supported` for which BYOK is permitted. Empty array → host serves all callers via platform-managed keys; clients MUST NOT send `ai.credentialRef` for non-BYOK providers. |
| `aiProviders.policies` | object | **(future)** | G22 — host-side policy enforcement modes (`disabled` / `optional` / `required` / `restricted`), resolution scopes, and the wire-format error code returned on denial. Omitted → no enforcement. See §"`aiProviders.policies`" below. |

### `configurable`

`(in-flight)` — schema for per-run parameter overrides accepted by `POST /v1/runs` `configurable` field. See `run-options.md` (forthcoming) for full semantics. The capability declaration enumerates the keys the server accepts:

```json
"configurable": {
  "model": { "type": "string", "description": "AI model override" },
  "temperature": { "type": "number", "min": 0, "max": 2 },
  "maxTokens": { "type": "number", "min": 1, "max": 8192 },
  "promptOverrides": { "type": "object" },
  "recursionLimit": { "type": "number", "min": 1, "max": 1000 }
}
```

A client MUST consult this capability before sending `configurable` values and MUST omit keys not listed. An unknown key on the wire MAY be rejected with `validation_error` or silently ignored — implementations differ; the spec recommends rejection so misconfiguration is loud.

### Runtime capabilities (**(future)** — G23)

`(future)` — additive post-v1.0 enhancement tracked as `WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATION_GAPS.md` G23. Lets a host advertise opaque host facilities that NodeModules can require via `NodeModule.requires?: readonly string[]`. The protocol owns the *check*; provider value shapes are documented per-capability alongside their consumers, NOT here.

```json
"runtimeCapabilities": ["chat.sendPrompt", "canvas.write", "secrets.byok"]
```

**Field shape:** array of unique non-empty strings. Capability ids are dotted, domain-scoped (conventional namespaces: `chat.*`, `canvas.*`, `secrets.*`, `media.*`).

**Client semantics.** A client that submits a workflow whose nodes declare `requires: ['chat.sendPrompt']` SHOULD first verify the host advertises that capability. A host that lacks a capability MUST refuse to dispatch nodes that declare it in `requires`, terminating the run with `RunSnapshot.error.code = 'capability_not_provided'` and the missing capability id in the error message.

**Backward compat.** Clients MUST tolerate the field's absence — only hosts that opt into G23 advertise it. NodeModules with no `requires` (the v1.0 status quo) are unaffected.

See `packages/workflow-engine/src/protocol/RuntimeCapabilityRegistry.ts` for the engine-side install/get pattern (mirrors `installEventLog` / `installSuspendManager`). Conformance scenario stub: `conformance/src/scenarios/runtime-capabilities.test.ts`.

### `secrets` (**(future)** — G22)

`(future)` — additive post-v1.0 enhancement tracked as `WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATION_GAPS.md` G22. Lets a host advertise that it supports secret-resolution + BYOK (Bring-Your-Own-Key) flows for AI provider credentials and other host-managed secrets.

```json
"secrets": {
  "supported": true,
  "scopes": ["tenant", "user", "run"],
  "resolution": "host-managed"
}
```

**Field shape:**

- `supported` (boolean) — host has any secret-resolution at all. Hosts that don't store credentials (e.g., test deployments) return `false` and clients MUST NOT attempt BYOK flows.
- `scopes` (string array, subset of `["tenant", "user", "run"]`) — declares which secret-storage scopes the host implements. A `tenant`-scoped secret is shared across the workspace; `user`-scoped is per-end-user; `run`-scoped is ephemeral per-run. Hosts that support multiple scopes return all of them.
- `resolution` (string, currently always `"host-managed"`) — the resolution mode. Reserved for forward-compat: future versions may add `"client-attached"` for clients that pass credentials inline (out of scope for v1.x — clients MUST use opaque references via `RunOptions.configurable.ai.credentialRef`).

**Client semantics.** Clients gate BYOK UX on `secrets.supported === true`. Without it, the BYOK flow is unavailable and the host serves all callers from platform-managed credentials.

**Server semantics.** Hosts that advertise secrets MUST implement `SecretResolver` (defined alongside the other host adapters in PRD §11 Phase 2). The `SecretResolver` returns opaque `ResolvedSecret` references that downstream provider adapters dereference internally — raw key material NEVER appears in the protocol surface (no events, logs, traces, prompts, errors, exports, screenshots).

**Hard rule (NFR-7):** any code path that emits a `RunEvent`, OTel span, log line, error message, or exported artifact MUST NOT contain raw key material. Hosts MUST add lint + redaction unit tests verifying this invariant before exposing the BYOK surface.

### `aiProviders` (**(future)** — G22)

`(future)` — companion to `secrets`. Advertises which AI providers the host's AI-proxy can route to and which permit BYOK.

```json
"aiProviders": {
  "supported": ["anthropic", "openai", "gemini"],
  "byok": ["anthropic", "openai"]
}
```

**Field shape:**

- `supported` (string array) — provider ids the host's AI-proxy can route to. Conventional ids: `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `mistral`, `cohere`, `vertex`, `bedrock`. Hosts MAY add vendor-prefixed extensions.
- `byok` (string array, subset of `supported`) — providers for which the host permits BYOK. Empty array → all calls use platform-managed keys; non-empty → clients MAY pass an opaque `ai.credentialRef` in `RunOptions.configurable` for matching providers.

**Client semantics.**

- `RunOptions.configurable.ai.provider` — selects the provider (must be in `supported`).
- `RunOptions.configurable.ai.model` — selects the model.
- `RunOptions.configurable.ai.credentialRef` — opaque host-issued reference to a stored secret (must reference a credential of a provider in `byok`).

**Server semantics.** Servers reject `ai.credentialRef` for providers NOT in `byok` with `credential_forbidden`. Servers reject unknown `provider` ids with `validation_error`.

### `aiProviders.policies` (**(future)** — G22)

`(future)` — additive companion to `aiProviders`. Lets a host advertise which **policy modes** it implements for per-provider gating. Hosts that omit this field implement no enforcement (clients see only `optional` semantics).

```json
"aiProviders": {
  "supported": ["anthropic", "openai", "gemini"],
  "byok": ["anthropic", "openai"],
  "policies": {
    "modes": ["disabled", "optional", "required", "restricted"],
    "scopes": ["workspace", "project", "canvas-type"],
    "errorCode": "provider_policy_denied"
  }
}
```

**Field shape:**

- `modes` (string array, subset of `["disabled", "optional", "required", "restricted"]`) — declares the policy modes this host can enforce. A host MAY support a subset (e.g., `["optional", "required"]`) — clients MUST tolerate any subset.
- `scopes` (string array, optional) — declares the resolution layers the host evaluates when computing the effective policy for a request. Conventional ids: `workspace`, `project`, `canvas-type`. Order is host-defined; the host MUST document its precedence rules.
- `errorCode` (string, optional, defaults to `provider_policy_denied`) — the wire-format error code returned when policy enforcement denies a request. Reserved for hosts that need a vendor-prefixed alias.

**The four modes** (host-side enforcement, opaque to the engine):

| Mode | Meaning | Pre-dispatch behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `disabled` | Provider MUST NOT be used at all. | Reject before LLM call with `provider_policy_denied` (`reason: "provider_disabled"`). |
| `optional` | No restriction. Default behavior; equivalent to no policy. | Permit. |
| `required` | Provider MAY only be used when the caller supplies BYOK credentials. | Two reject paths: pre-resolve, when `RunOptions.configurable.ai.credentialRef` is absent (`reason: "byok_required"`); post-resolve, when the credential reference was supplied but the resolver returned no usable secret (`reason: "byok_required_but_unresolved"`). |
| `restricted` | Provider use is limited to an allowlist of model patterns. | Reject when the requested model does not match any wildcard in `allowedModels` (`reason: "model_not_allowed"`). The same `reason` covers the case where the resolved `restricted` policy has an empty/missing `allowedModels` — a misconfigured policy fails closed via the same wire shape, with `allowed: []` in the error context. |

**`allowedModels`** is the per-policy companion field for `restricted` mode — a list of glob patterns matched against `RunOptions.configurable.ai.model`. Hosts MUST treat a `restricted` policy with no `allowedModels` as fail-closed; the rejection surfaces via `reason: "model_not_allowed"` (with an empty `allowed` array in the error context to disambiguate from the "model unmatched" subcase). The shape of stored policy documents (per-workspace / per-project / per-canvas-type) is host-internal and not part of the wire protocol.

**Wire-format error.** When policy enforcement denies a request, the host MUST respond with the `errorCode` advertised above (default `provider_policy_denied`) and SHOULD include a machine-readable `reason` field with one of `["provider_disabled", "byok_required", "byok_required_but_unresolved", "model_not_allowed"]`. The error MUST NOT echo the resolved policy document — only the *decision*. This shape applies whether the denial surfaces as an HTTP error (REST), a JSON-RPC error (MCP), or a stream chunk's `errorCode` (streaming AI responses).

**Resolver behavior.**

- A host MAY layer policy resolution across multiple scopes (workspace → project → canvas-type). The effective policy is the host's deterministic merge of layer outputs; precedence is host-defined and SHOULD be documented per-deployment.
- If the resolver itself is unavailable (network outage, storage failure), hosts SHOULD fail-open to `optional` rather than fail-closed — denying ALL requests during resolver outage breaks the runbook unrecoverably.
- The single exception is a `restricted` policy that resolved successfully but contains an empty/missing `allowedModels` — that's a misconfigured policy, not an outage, and MUST fail-closed (surfacing as `reason: "model_not_allowed"` with `allowed: []`).

**Audit emission.** Hosts SHOULD emit a per-decision audit event (host-internal taxonomy; conventional name `policy.decision`) carrying the resolved policy + which scope-layer supplied each field. The exact payload shape is host-internal and NOT part of the wire protocol — clients learn the *outcome* through the `provider_policy_denied` error, not by subscribing to audit events.

**Backward compat.** Clients MUST tolerate the field's absence. A host that omits `policies` is equivalent to one that advertises `{"modes": ["optional"]}` and never returns `provider_policy_denied`.

### `observability`

`(in-flight)` — see `observability.md` (forthcoming).

```json
"observability": {
  "namespace": "wop",
  "spanAttributes": [
    "wop.run_id",
    "wop.node_id",
    "wop.node_type",
    "wop.event_seq",
    "wop.workflow_id",
    "wop.protocol_version"
  ],
  "spanNames": ["wop.run", "wop.node.<typeId>", "wop.interrupt"]
}
```

A server that exports OTel traces MUST use the `wop.*` namespace. Aliasing to vendor-specific taxonomies (e.g., `langgraph.*`, `datadog.*`) is per-deployment configuration, NOT spec'd.

---

## Engine-enforced limits and the `cap.breached` event (closes CC-1 spec-side)

The four `Capabilities.limits` fields (`clarificationRounds`, `schemaRounds`, `envelopesPerTurn`, `maxNodeExecutions`) are engine-enforced — the server MUST emit a `cap.breached` event AND fail the run / node when an attempted operation would exceed the configured ceiling. All four kinds share the same event surface (`run-event-payloads.schema.json#$defs.capBreached`) so consumers handle one event with a `kind` discriminator instead of N parallel surfaces.

### `cap.breached` payload

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | One of `clarification`, `schema`, `envelopes`, `node-executions`. |
| `limit` | integer | The ceiling that was tripped (server-resolved value — see §Resolution below). |
| `observed` | integer | The observed value at the moment of trip. Always strictly greater than `limit`. |
| `nodeId` | string (optional) | Set for node-scoped limits (`clarification`, `schema`). Absent for run-scoped (`envelopes`, `node-executions`). |

### Resolution: `recursionLimit` + `maxNodeExecutions`

For the `node-executions` kind specifically (which is the runtime invariant for `recursionLimit`):

1. The server resolves the effective limit as `min(RunOptions.configurable.recursionLimit, Capabilities.limits.maxNodeExecutions)`. If the caller didn't supply `configurable.recursionLimit`, the server uses `maxNodeExecutions` directly.
2. The server validates the caller's supplied value at run-create time via the `validateRecursionLimit()` helper documented in `run-options.md`. Out-of-range values return `400 validation_error` BEFORE the run starts — never at runtime.
3. The server maintains a per-run `nodeExecutionCount` counter, incremented on every node-state transition into `started`.
4. When `nodeExecutionCount > resolvedLimit`, the server:
   - Emits `cap.breached` with `kind: 'node-executions'`, `limit: resolvedLimit`, `observed: nodeExecutionCount`.
   - Transitions the run to `failed`.
   - Sets `RunSnapshot.error.code = 'recursion_limit_exceeded'` and `RunSnapshot.error.message` to a human-readable description.
   - Stops scheduling further nodes.

The other three kinds follow analogous patterns (per `clarification` / `schema` / `envelopes` semantics in §In-package shape above), differing only in *what* gets counted and *which counter* resets when.

### What this closes

- **CC-1**: the `recursionLimit` runtime invariant. The validation half (`validateRecursionLimit()`) shipped 2026-04-26; the runtime half lands here as a unified `cap.breached` emission rather than a separate event class. No `eventLogSchemaVersion` bump required — `cap.breached` already exists with `node-executions` in its `kind` enum (per `run-event-payloads.schema.json` and the `wop.cap_kind` OTel attribute in `observability.md`).
- **CC-4**: `Capabilities.limits.maxNodeExecutions` is now `(stable)`. Default `100`. The clamp ceiling for `recursionLimit` overrides.

### Industry-standard alignment

Modern workflow engines unify limit-related failures under a small set of event types:

- LangGraph: `GraphRecursionError` (single error class).
- Temporal / Cadence: cap exceedance folds under `WorkflowExecutionTimedOut` / `ActivityTaskFailed` with reason discriminator.
- AWS Step Functions: `ExecutionFailed` with `error: "States.Runtime"` covers all runtime caps.

WOP follows the same pattern: `cap.breached` with a `kind` discriminator covers all four engine-enforced caps.

### Conformance fixture

`conformance-cap-breach` (specced in `conformance/fixtures.md`) exercises the path end-to-end: 10 sequential noop nodes + `configurable.recursionLimit: 5` → terminal `failed` + `cap.breached` event with `kind: 'node-executions'`. Once the impl plan owner ships the runtime counter, the fixture lands without spec changes.

---

## Status legend

- **(stable)** — field shape locked. Implementations should support today.
- **(in-flight)** — driven by impl plan PRs (3b.1 and adjacent) currently in development. Shape may shift in compatible ways before WOP v1.0 final. Implementers SHOULD NOT pin to exact field shapes yet.
- **(future)** — deferred to a later spec milestone (v1.x or v2). MAY be omitted from current capability responses.

---

## Capability negotiation flow

A typical client startup:

```
1. Client → GET /.well-known/wop
2. Server → 200 OK, Capabilities JSON
3. Client checks:
   - protocolVersion satisfies my pinned floor?  → if not, abort with version-mismatch UX
   - implementation.version known?               → log advisory if mismatch
   - minClientVersion ≤ my version?              → if not, abort with upgrade-required UX
   - supportedEnvelopes includes envelopes I emit? → if not, narrow my behavior
   - limits compatible with my workload?         → if not, surface to user
4. Client → first protocol request
```

The server MUST NOT change capability response shape mid-session in a way that invalidates a client's prior negotiation. If the server's capabilities change (e.g., new node pack registered), it MAY surface this via a `Capabilities-Etag` response header that clients can probe periodically.

---

## Backward compatibility

Adding new fields to the `Capabilities` shape is non-breaking — clients ignore unknown fields. Removing or renaming fields is breaking and MUST be accompanied by a `protocolVersion` bump.

The status markers (stable/in-flight/future) protect implementers from premature-pinning: an implementer reading this doc today should pin only to **(stable)** fields and consult the impl plan's PR 3b.1 outcomes before shipping support for **(in-flight)** fields.

---

## Open spec gaps

| # | Gap | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | `Capabilities` TypeScript type is being defined in impl plan PR 3b.1 — re-sync this doc after that PR lands | impl plan |
| C2 | `Capabilities-Etag` header for mid-session capability change detection | future |
| C3 | Capability negotiation handshake for non-HTTP transports (MCP, A2A) | P2-F6 |
| C4 | Vendor extensions namespace (e.g., `vendor.<org>.*`) for adding non-spec fields without conflicting | future |
| C5 | Per-tenant capability scoping (a public key may see fewer capabilities than an admin key on the same server) | future v1.x |
